## Prince Forecasts the Weather

Notes/to-do:

- App will fetch weather forecast and set state, then pass data down to Weather container via props.
- Weather container will render WeatherCards using data in props.

1. Create WeatherCards and render via Weather container.
2. Populate with dummy data following state/props path from App -> Weather -> WeatherCards.
3. When rendering correctly, create fetch request in App to pull and pass down real data.
4. Fun part! Find Prince images for each weather type.
5. Update WeatherCards to render correct image based on data.
6. Style!
